### Scratch / Notes ###

# Approach: Do forward search instead now. See if we can upgrade to b&b later.
#
# To do: Update ourselves on course content.
#
# Question: Is b&b actully helpful? Or should we just use forward search
#
# Lower bound (for value function)-> We die.
# Can we ever calculate a higher lower bound than that?
# It seems like that's what we need to make b&b helpful.
#     - Max damage we can take = max damage we've taken
#
# Upper bound (action value function) -> We kill the foe, lose no more hp.
#     - What max damage can we do? Is it greater than the foe's hp?
#
# What is our "expert knowledge" that allows us to bound?
# Are soft bounds based on beliefs okay?
